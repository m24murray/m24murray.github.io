For starting out, I generally favour models which include a full-sized HDMI port as well as at least 2 USB 2.0 ports. Getting started There are countless number of guides and tools which will talk help get your Raspberry Pi up-and-running. In my opinion, I think using the Raspberry Pi Imager is a great place to start and will easily install the Raspberry Pi OS to your device. Troubleshooting If you ever break your Raspberry Pi, just re-flash the image.
