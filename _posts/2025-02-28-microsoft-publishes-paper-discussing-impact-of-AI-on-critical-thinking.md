Microsoft have recently published a research paper titled,
["The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking: Self-Reported Reductions in Cognitive Effort and Confidence Effects From a Survey of Knowledge Workers".](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf)

This seems to be a familiar pattern of a technology company researching the impact of that technology and finding that
it has negative effects.

One of the main takeaways is that, _"[GenAI] can inhibit critical engagement with work and can potentially lead to
long-term overreliance on the tool and diminished skill
for independent problem-solving"_. And while this is cause for concern for those who find AI being utilised more in
their day-to-day jobs, I do wonder if there is slightly more nuance to it.

That GenAI can have a detrimental impact on peoples cognition and critical thinking isn't new information, this has long
been suspected of being the case, however what's interesting is that the effects seem to vary significantly depending on
what confidence a user has in the outputs from GenAI. Higher confidence and trust in GenAI relates to less critical
thinking.

## The survey

As part of this study, **319 knowledge workers were surveyed** as to how they use Gen AI and what impact they perceive
on it having on their work. From these workers, **936 examples** of using GenAI in work were identified throughout the
duration of the survey.

## Why this matters

I think the uptake of AI tools across many industries (including software engineering) has been at such a rapid pace,
there has not been enough consideration to its impact. We expect that training data used by AI will worsen over time as
the
proportion of non-GenAI code decreases compared to that which has been AI generated. In addition, we can expect more
homogenous outputs due to a lack of creative and original data that is produced by humans. But what if our ability to
create that new data is hindered because we lack the cognitive ability to do so.

## History repeats itself

Critics of the AI revolution will often reference recent technological advances to warn of cognitive decline and
impending doom. Calculators ("You won't be able to do sums in your head"), mobile phones ("You won't be able to remember
phone numbers") and the internet ("You won't be able to remember information").
However, what I didn't realise is that this conversation is much older than we think.

Over 2000 years ago, Socrates objected to the written form of knowledge suggesting that it would weaken memory and that
written knowledge was superior as it allowed for questioning and critical thinking.

Similarly, Johannes Trithemius, a 15th Century German scholar rallied against printed books, stating that it lacked
the "spiritual and intellectual discipline of handwriting".

## Cognitive offloading

## The results

## Some other considerations...

* Obviously as a piece of AI propaganda, Microsoft push the narrative that we should be considering the options of AI to
  _improve_ the ability of people to work in certain ways.
* Its worth noting that this survey relies on of self-evaluation and opinions of experience rather than an objective
  perspective. As a result, I don't think this makes the conclusions from this survey airtight, but it still gives us
  food for thought.
